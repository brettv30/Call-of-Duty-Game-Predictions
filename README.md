# Project Goals
1. Learn about the important factors that play into a team's Wins and Losses for Search & Destroy Matches
2. See how well we can predict a team's Wins and Losses 
3. Further develop my Python coding ability

# Important Factors


# Project Interest
As an avid Call of Duty player, I thought it would be interesting to couple my love for the video game franchise and my passion for data science and investigate the possibility of predicting the outcome of Search & Destroy games from the CWL. Utilizing Python, I was able to create a logistic regression binary classification model that provided insight into the major factors that go in to a team winning a Search and Destroy match. It is worth it to note here that we are predicting whether a team Won or Lost a match, not a specific round, although it wouldn't be hard to transfer some of these findings to a round by round basis.
